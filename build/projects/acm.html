                <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
                <p> Having grown to be one of <u>UCSD’s largest computing organizations</u>, ACM at UCSD sought to build a new website that recognizes the contributions of its members and showcases the events and initiatives that it brings to the UCSD student community.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="proj-detail-section">
                <h5>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h5>
                <p> A computing community should have a website that is <u>representative of the technical expertise of its members</u>, while also <u>publicizing the organization’s initiatives and events</u>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="proj-detail-section">
                <h5>WHY A NEW WEBSITE?</h5>
                <p>
                    As a student, the reputation of a student organization can make a difference in deciding whether one wants to involve themselves in the organization. What’s the easiest way of building credibility? A performant and representative website is a must for such organizations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Acknowledging this necessity can make a difference in the initial impression that people would have about the organization, and therefore it needs to be carefully crafted to be <u>representative of all the aspects that compose the organization</u>.

                <h5>DECIDING ON A TECH STACK</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <u>React with Gatsby</u>: With the need for the reusability of components and extensive use of React within the organization, React was the clear choice. But we sought to find a React framework that allowed for easy scalability, and we ended up with Gatsby.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>LESS</u>: An organizational website would need to define a particular visual identity that is synchronous throughout all of its pages. A powerful CSS preprocessor was necessary to allow for streamlined styling organization.

                <h5>CREATING A SPACE FOR<br/>FUTURE ENHANCEMENT</h5>
                <p>As an organizational website, there comes the expectation that the website would have to be updated on a regular basis.</p>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <u>Utilizing existing backend services within the organization</u>: We leveraged an existing backend API that stores upcoming events of the organization, and therefore centralized the event updating mechanism to be independent of the website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Taking advantage of the BEM naming convention</u>: With the power of LESS nesting capabilities, BEM was the preferred convention to name the classes within the application. This allowed for a more readable stylesheet in addition to easily understandable class naming.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <u>Intentional repository organization</u>: One of the main issues with the original website was the fact that there was no particular attention placed to the design of the code repository. With this project, the other developer and I made sure to focus on component modularity, which allowed for better onboarding for new developers and easier future changes to the organization of certain pages. Improvements to individual components would also be easier considering the isolation of each component's functionality to its own file. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h5>WORKING IN <br/> MULTIFUNCTIONAL TEAMS</h5>
                <p>With this project being one of my first experiences working in a team that is composed of a product manager, designers and developers, it became necessary to acknowledge the importance of communication. Along the way, there was a need for a constant back and forth, so that the developers understood what the designers intended through the original designs.</p>
                <p>We adopted the Agile methodology to regulate the project’s progress, with certain tasks (stories) being assigned to each individual in the team. With Agile came the benefit of iterative development, in which design changes throughout the development process were expected. As a result, developers had to always be prepared to make slight changes to existing components in case of any new improvements or suggestions. There was value in using Agile, through which it helped <u>ensure the continuous progress</u> of the project and gave consistent deadlines to each team member.</p>
                <p>It was interesting to experience working in a team that had more designers than developers, and this turned out to be a lot of help in terms of <u>clarifying the design expectations</u> while also ensuring that designs were being delivered on time. I think that this type of balance was appropriate for a static website, since most of the <u>emphasis was on the content</u> as opposed to the functionality provided by the website.</p>
